Reflective Report
=============================

Tools I have used in the past
-------------------------------
I have a lot of experience with Python because I have been using it for about 5 or 6 years. This is because my GCSE and 
A Level in computer science both used python as part of the exams. However, I had also experimented with Python by 
making a text based adventure which had inspiration from one of my favourite video games, which gave me access to 
different ways of using python other than what was specified by the exam boards.

In the past, I have used an in-built IDE in Unity to create a computer game I made for my Computer Science A Level.
However, the IDE I used was for C# and not for python which means they can be similar in certain ways but most of it was 
brand new. Also, the last time I used the Unity IDE was about six months ago so I had forgotten a lot of the knowledge
on how IDE's worked due to it.

The new tools and how they will change my development practice
--------------------------------------------------------
The first new tool I used was GitLab, which makes it easier to store and view the same file in different stages of
development. This is very useful in understanding where problems have arisen as you can go back and check if something
has gone wrong. The cloning and forking makes checking errors in a new file before adding them to the one that is being
used to store all the completed or useful programs very easy. Therefore, changing my development practice because i can
store all different versions together, being able to sort through them easily.

The second tool I used was PyCharm, the python IDE. PyCharm using Git to check version control will greatly change how
I save and use python in the future because I can save my work without necessarily overwriting the previous work. 
PyCharm also makes having multiple files of different types easy to keep track of. For example, the Markdown files and
Python files are easily distinguished but can easily be looked at without needing some other software to be able to read
it. This will change my development practice because i can work on python files and other text files at the same time 
without needing to move from program to program in order to edit them.

The next tool is what connects PyCharm and Git. Version Control is almost unheard of outside of computing and that is
something that should change, because it can save so much time and effort when there has been an error made. This is 
because you can just go back to a previous version, without needing to restart and allows you to merge different 
versions of the same file at the same time. This will change my development practice because I will be using it to work
out and sort out problems within my code between versions. 

The Dependency Management tool was not used much in this practical but was a good visual on how connected a python
programme we have made can be to so many other programs from various different people from all over the world. This,
to me, is very useful since it shows how a programmer could be dealing with a very large number of files in a short time
frame. This will change my development practice by making sure I check my Dependency Management tool throughout making a
program to know what is connected to what and how large my program actually is and if any need updating or not. 

The 'RTM', while not being a tool, is useful since it gives a starting area from which a person could build their skills
with Panda and slowly improve. Once they have mastered any tutorials they may be able to make something which someone
wants and would be able to transfer the skills to mastering another type of coding within the same language.
